## Overview

The Unity Splash Screen Remover is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to remove the Unity splash screen logo + [watermark](https://forum.unity.com/threads/i-am-using-personal-but-there-is-trial-version-water-mark-after-build.591610/#post-3975343) from Unity-built games.

The tool is an implementation of the guide available at <https://github.com/kiraio-moe/remove-unity-splash-screen>. By utilizing this tool, you can easily remove Unity splash screen logo from your games and keep your own logo displayed.

## Requirements

- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0 ".NET 6.0 SDK") or [.NET 7.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0 ".NET 7.0 SDK")
- Splash screen `Draw Mode` have been set to `All Sequential` in `Player Settings`.

## Usages

To use the tool, follow the steps below:

- Download USSR from [Releases](https://github.com/kiraio-moe/USSR/releases) page.
- There's many ways to use USSR. Choose which one you feel most comfortable with.

  1. Drag and drop your game executable `(*.exe|*.x86|*.x86_64|*.dmg|index.html)` directly to `USSR.exe`, not in opened console window!
  2. Drag and drop `globalgamemanagers` or `data.unity3d` file (_`WebGL.data` currently are not supported_) directly to `USSR.exe`.
  3. Execute USSR on CLI:

      ```bash
      USSR.exe <path/to/(*.exe|*.x86|*.x86_64|*.dmg|index.html|globalgamemanagers|data.unity3d|WebGL.data)>
      ```

### Android

- Make sure you already have [`JDK`](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=416&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All "OpenJDK") & [`SDK`](https://androidsdkoffline.blogspot.com/p/all-android-sdk-latest-stable-versions.html) installed. In another word, you can build your game in Unity Editor.
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio "Android Studio") installed. Make sure to set the `JDK` and `SDK` path to the one you used for Unity Editor.
- Follow these steps:

  - **Check** `Export Project` in `Build Settings` then export.
  - After exported, **remove** the splash screen at `<export_result>/unityLibrary/src/main/assets/bin/Data/`.
  - **Remove** the backup file (`*.bak`) generated by USSR or **move** to somewhere else outside of `<export_result>`.
  - **Import** the exported project to `Android Studio`.
  - **Build** the project.
  - If you want to upload your game to app store (e.g. Google Play Store), you can `sign` your game with `keystore` and build the project as app bundle (`.aab`).  
  I won't cover those steps here, because you can find them pretty much on the internet.

### iOS

> This section may have some incorrect information. If you found one, feel free to create an Issue/Pull Request.

- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ "Xcode") installed.
- There's no fancy settings to be checked, just **Build** (export) the project.
- **Remove** the splash screen at `<export_result>/Data/`.
- **Remove** the backup file (`*.bak`) generated by USSR or **move** to somewhere else outside of `<export_result>`.
- **Open** `Unity-iPhone.xcodeproj` with Xcode, then proceed to build.  
  If you're an iOS developer, you know what to do next, right?
